      "summary": "Detecting depression is complex due to variable symptoms arising from individual differences. Our research aims to create a novel classification system for diagnosing depression, considering historical data (like activity levels) and verbal/non-verbal cues (pitch, gaze). We built a real-world dataset combining 14-day smartphone records and audio-visual data, while extracting physiological/behavioral features. Using Decision trees and SVM classifiers with fusion methods, we found SVM with late fusion achieves 89% accuracy. We validated this approach on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, reinforcing its effectiveness."
